    "### Inferential Statistics\n",
    "* Mostly interested in producing good **parameter estimates**: Construct models with unbiased estimates of $\\beta$, capturing the relationship  $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "* Supposedly \\enquote{structural} models: Causal effect of directionality $x \\rightarrow y$, robust across a variety of observed as well as up to now unobserved settings.\n",
    "* How: Carefully draw from  theories and empirical findings, apply logical reasoning to formulate hypotheses.\n",
    "* Typically, multivariate testing, cetris paribus.\n",
    "* Main concern: Minimize standard errors $\\epsilon$ of $\\beta$ estimates.\n",
    "* Not overly concerned with overall predictive power (eg. $R^2$) of those models, but about various type of endogeneity issues, leading us to develop sophisticated **identification strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ML\\&AI Approach\n",
    "* To large extend driven by the needs of the private sector $\\rightarrow$ data analysis is gear towards producing good **predictions** of outcomes $\\rightarrow$ fits for $\\hat{y}$, not $\\hat{\\beta}$\n",
    "     * Recommender systems: Amazon, Netflix, Sportify ect.\n",
    "     * Risk scores}: Eg.g likelihood that a particular person has an accident, turns sick, or defaults on their credit.\n",
    "     * Image classification: Finding Cats \\& Dogs online\n",
    "* Often rely on big data (N,$x_i$)\n",
    "* Not overly concerned with the properties of parameter estimates, but very rigorous in optimizing the overall prediction accuracy.\n",
    "* Often more flexibility wrt. the functional form, and non-parametric approaches.\n",
    "* No \"build-in\"\" causality guarantee $\\rightarrow$ verification techniques.\n",
    "* Often sporadically used in econometric procedures, but seen as \"son of a lesser god\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## ML model selection, tuning, and validation processes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalization via \"Out-of-Sample-Testing\"\n",
    "\n",
    "With so much freedom wrt. feature selection, functional form ect., models are prone to over-fitting. And no constraints by asymptotic properties, causality and so forth, how can we generalize anything?\n",
    "\n",
    "In ML, generalization is not achived by statistical derivatives and theoretical argumentation, but rather by answering the practical question: **How well would my model perform with new data?** To answer this question, **Out-of-Sample-Testing** is usually taken as solution. Here, you do the following\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the dataset in a training and a test sample.\n",
    "2. Fit you regression (train your model) on one dataset\n",
    "     * Optimal: Tune hyperparameters by minimizing loss in a validation set.\n",
    "     * Optimal: Retrain final model configuration on whole training set\n",
    "3. Finally, evaluate predictive power on test sample, on which model is not fitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advanced version is a **N-fold-Crossvalidation**, where this process is repeated several time during the **hyperparameter-tuning** phase (more on that later).\n",

    "### Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule-of-thumb: Richer and more complex functional forms and algorithms tend to be better in predictign complex real world pattern. This is particularly true for high-dimensional (big) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/66o5gvtaeh6n5ut/learningmodels.png?dl=1){width=750px}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, flexible algorithms at one point become so good in mimicing the pattern in our data that they **overfit**, meaning are to much tuned towards a specific dataset and might not reproduce the same accuracy in new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we call this tension the **bias-variance tradeoff**, which we can decompose in the two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bias Error** The simplifying assumptions made by a model to make the target function easier to learn. Generally, simple parametric algorithms have a high bias making them fast to learn and easier to understand but generally less flexible. In turn, they have lower predictive performance on complex problems that fail to meet the simplifying assumptions of the algorithms bias. In turn, they are less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "* **Variance Error:** Variance is the amount that the estimate of the target function will change if different data was used. Ideally, it should not change too much from one training dataset to the next, meaning that the algorithm is good at picking out the hidden underlying mapping between the inputs and the output variables. Generally, nonparametric and complex ML algorithms tend to that have a lot of flexibility have a high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the predictive performance (on new data) of algorithms and models will always depend on this trade-off between bias and variance. Mathematically, this can be formalized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\displaystyle \\operatorname {E} {\\Big [}{\\big (}y-{\\hat {f}}(x){\\big )}^{2}{\\Big ]}={\\Big (}\\operatorname {Bias} {\\big [}{\\hat {f}}(x){\\big ]}{\\Big )}^{2}+\\operatorname {Var} {\\big [}{\\hat {f}}(x){\\big ]}+\\sigma ^{2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that why bias and variance are reducible errors which decline when using a more suitable model to model the underlying relationships in the data, $\\sigma^2$ denotes the unreducible complexity caused by random noise, measurement errors, or missing variables, which represent a boundary to our ability to predict given the data at hand.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Easy to Understand: Decision tree output is very easy to understand even for people from non-analytical background.\n",
    "* Useful in Data exploration: Decision tree is one of the fastest way to identify most significant variables and relation between two or more variables.\n",

It is among the most popular non-neural-network ML algorithms, and by some considered to be a panacea of all data science problems. Some say: \"when you can't think of any algorithm (irrespective of situation), use random forest!\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As a continuation of tree-based classification methods, random forests aim at reducing overfitting by introducing randomness via bootstrapping, boosting, and ensemble techniques. It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful model. The idea here is to create an \"ensemble of classification trees\"\", all grown out of a different bootstrap sample. Having grown a forest of trees, every tree performs a prediction, and the final model prediction is formed by a majority vote of all trees. This idea close to Monte Carlo simulation approaches, tapping in the power of randomness.\n",

    "In this case, we draw from a number of tunable hyperparameters. First, we tune the number of randomly selected features which are available candidates for every split on a range $[1,k-1]$, where lower values introduce a higher level of randomness to every split. Our second hyperparameter is the minimal number of observations which have to fall in every split, where lower numbers increase the potential precision of splits, but also the risk of overfitting. Finally, we also use the general splitrule as an hyperparameter, where the choice is between i.) a traditional split according to a the optimization of the gini coefficient of the distribution of classes in every split, and ii.) according to the \"Extremely randomized trees\"\" (`ExtraTree`) procedure by Geurts (2016), where adittional randomness is introduced to the selection of splitpoints.\n",
